4. 6 Repetition Principle
   
The test module in our application uses the "6 repetition principle" to help users retain the words they have learned permanently. According to this principle:

Repeated Tests: For each word, the same question is asked to the user six times in a row.
Correct Answer: The user must answer the same question correctly six times.
Incorrect Answer Scenario: If the user does not answer correctly six times, the question goes back to the beginning, and the user is expected to answer it correctly six more times.
Moving to Known Question Pool: If the user answers correctly six times, that question is moved to the known question pool.
Repetition Timing: The time for retesting a known question is predetermined. The intervals for this timing are: 1 day later, 1 week later, 1 month later, 3 months later, 6 months later, and 1 year later. These timeframes are optimized to ensure the long-term retention of learned information in long-term memory.
This principle is an effective method for ensuring the long-term recall of learned words.
